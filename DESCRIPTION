Description: The goal of this package is to provide an improved version of 
    WA-PLS (Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares) by including the 
    tolerances of taxa and the frequency of the sampled climate variable. 
    This package also provides a way of leave-out cross-validation that 
    removes both the test site and sites that are both geographically 
    close and climatically close for each cycle, to avoid the risk of 
    pseudo-replication.
