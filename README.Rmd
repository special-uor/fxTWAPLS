## Overview

The goal of this package is to provide an improved version of WA-PLS by 
including the tolerances of taxa and the frequency of the sampled climate 
variable. This package also provides a way of leave-out cross-validation that 
removes both the test site and sites that are both geographically close and 
climatically close for each cycle, to avoid the risk of pseudo-replication.

## Installation

<!-- ### Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for Github -->
<!-- This is needed to install packages from private repositories. Once configured, -->
<!-- there is no need to configure it again. -->

You can install the released version of fxTWAPLS from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fxTWAPLS) with:

``` r
install.packages("fxTWAPLS")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/special-uor/fxTWAPLS/) with:
<!-- You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("special-uor/fxTWAPLS", "dev")
```

<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

## Notes
The following functions can be executed in parallel:

- [`cv.pr.w`](https://special-uor.github.io/fxTWAPLS/reference/cv.pr.w.html)
- [`cv.w`](https://special-uor.github.io/fxTWAPLS/reference/cv.w.html)
- [`get_distance`](https://special-uor.github.io/fxTWAPLS/reference/get_distance.html)
- [`get_pseudo`](https://special-uor.github.io/fxTWAPLS/reference/get_pseudo.html)
- [`sse.sample`](https://special-uor.github.io/fxTWAPLS/reference/sse.sample.html)

To do so, include the `cpus` parameter. For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# without fx
cv_Tmin <- fxTWAPLS::cv.w(taxa,
                          modern_pollen$Tmin,
                          nPLS = 5,
                          fxTWAPLS::WAPLS.w,
                          fxTWAPLS::WAPLS.predict.w,
                          cpus = 2)
```

Optionally, a progress bar can be displayed for long computations. Just "pipe" the
function call to `fxTWAPLS::pb()`.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# without fx
`%>%` <- magrittr::`%>%`
cv_Tmin <- fxTWAPLS::cv.w(taxa,
                          modern_pollen$Tmin,
                          nPLS = 5,
                          fxTWAPLS::WAPLS.w,
                          fxTWAPLS::WAPLS.predict.w,
                          cpus = 2) %>%
  fxTWAPLS::pb()
```

Alternatively, if you are not familiar with the "pipe" operator, you can run the
following code:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# without fx
cv_Tmin <- fxTWAPLS::pb(fxTWAPLS::cv.w(taxa,
                                       modern_pollen$Tmin,
                                       nPLS = 5,
                                       fxTWAPLS::WAPLS.w,
                                       fxTWAPLS::WAPLS.predict.w,
                                       cpus = 2))
  
```
