## Overview

The goal of this package is to provide an improved version of WA-PLS by 
including the tolerances of taxa and the frequency of the sampled climate 
variable. This package also provides a way of leave-out cross-validation that 
removes both the test site and sites that are both geographically close and 
climatically close for each cycle, to avoid the risk of pseudo-replication.

## Installation

<!-- ### Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for Github -->
<!-- This is needed to install packages from private repositories. Once configured, -->
<!-- there is no need to configure it again. -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # install.packages("usethis") -->
<!-- usethis::browse_github_pat(scopes = "repo",  -->
<!--                            description = "R:GITHUB_PAT",  -->
<!--                            host = "https://github.com/special-uor") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Copy the generated token. Then, run the following command: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- usethis::edit_r_environ() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Add a new line to the `.Renviron` file: -->
<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- GITHUB_PAT=xxxyyyzzz -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Make sure to leave a new empty line after `GITHUB_PAT`. Restart R (Session >  -->
<!-- Restart R in the RStudio menu bar), as environment variables are loaded from  -->
<!-- `.Renviron` only at the start of an R session.  -->
<!-- Check that the PAT is now available like so: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- usethis::git_sitrep() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can install the released version of fxTWAPLS from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("fxTWAPLS") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("special-uor/fxTWAPLS")
```
